## Intro to the Violin Training App
This is still an ongoing project.
Therefore before I finish dealing with my PC disk problem and switch backend to C#,
Please kindly ignore the backend and visit the frontend part with the instruction below.
The app is fully capable as a violin tuning gadget, while this author try on experimenting something else with the custom and login part (they will be done along with the completion of the backend).
